#Drexel-University-Student-Enrollment-Data-Analysis



I was given two CSV Files to analyze by using data visualization for a Data Analyst interview with Drexel University. Below are some of the guiding principles that I received from the hiring committee:

1. We have two goals with this task. First, we want to get a sense for how you approach a new dataset; we encourage you to preserve all the code you write, regardless if you use it in the presentation. Second, we want to see how you present information to technical and non-technical people.

2. As a follow-up to the first point, please do not worry about your code being clean. If you spend time exploring a particular variable but decide your first attempt at doing so fails, don’t delete the code!

3. Your presentation should assume that the committee has never seen this dataset. Please don’t take the basics for granted!

4. While the dataset is inspired by real Drexel data, the data themselves are totally fake. Please do not extrapolate any relationships you may find in this fake data set to reality.

5. Focus on data exploration, not prediction.

6. We really like good data visualization. Please include pretty tables and plots.


The goal was to provide graphs and charts that would give insights into the data regarding Data Enrollment for Drexel University students. It is worth mentioning that there is a difference between admission and enrollment: admission refers to students who receive an offer from the university, while enrollment specifically refers to the group of admitted students who choose to accept the university offer. This means that students can decline enrollment for different reasons including: an offer with more financial aid from another university, an offer from a more prestigious university and/or program, an offer from a university closer to the state of origin (this way it is easier to visit family and friends). The Python file goes through the entire process starting from Data Reading to Data Visualization.


Finally, a PDF presentation is also provided working through explaining the graphs, my comments on them, and a conclusion at the end of the key findings and areas of further research that can be conducted on this project.
